My Highschool Grade 12 Final Assignment:
A python script that demonstates knowledge of Sorting, Recursion, Looping, Classes and Objects.
The script runs of unsorted data provided by : http://www.geonames.org/export/ , and uses the Google Maps API to visually display it on a Map.
It is currently being worked on to look better and be more efficient.
